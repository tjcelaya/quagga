quagga
======

Quagga is an experiment in building a web-based development environment for the
Q/Kdb+ platform by Kx Systems.

Run
---

```
$ sh start.sh 
```

And then open a browser session to [http://localhost:8888].

Edit start.sh to change port.

Current Status
--------------

Barely works. Needs complete rewrite. Terrible.
