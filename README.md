quagga
======

Quagga is an experiment in building a web-based development environment for the
Q/Kdb+ platform by Kx Systems.

Run
---

```
$ sh start.sh 
```

And then open a browser session to [http://localhost:8888/index.html].

Edit start.sh to change port.

Current Status
--------------

Barely works. Needs complete rewrite. Terrible.

TODO
----

* Rewrite with Mithril (or failing that React)
* Context sensitive help
* Wiki docs
